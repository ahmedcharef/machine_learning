Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. 

While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:
* The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning.
* Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life.
* Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation.
* Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.

Among the different types of ML tasks, a crucial distinction is drawn between supervised and unsupervised learning:

Supervised machine learning: The program is “trained” on a pre-defined set of “training examples”, which then facilitate its ability to reach an accurate conclusion when given new data.
Unsupervised machine learning: The program is given a bunch of data and must find patterns and relationships therein.
